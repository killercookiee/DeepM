File functions:
/medical-image-segmentation         # This is the cloned repository of the dataset
    /dataset                        # This is the original dataset
    /MIS-working-dataset            # This is the dataset which is prepared

- DeepM_main_dataprep.ipynb         # This is file which was used to prepare the data
- DeepM_main_baseline.ipynb         # This is the file which will be the baseline
- DeepM_main_baseline.ipynb         # This is the file which will be our model



Instructions:
- Just run DeepM_main_dataprep.ipynb to see how the data was prepared
